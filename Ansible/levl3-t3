## Task

Create an Ansible playbook
Create an empty file blog.txt under /opt/devops/ directory on app server 1. Set some acl properties for this file. Using acl provide read '(r)' permissions to group tony (i.e entity is tony and etype is group).

Create an empty file story.txt under /opt/devops/ directory on app server 2. Set some acl properties for this file. Using acl provide read + write '(rw)' permissions to user steve (i.e entity is steve and etype is user).
Create an empty file media.txt under /opt/devops/ on app server 3. Set some acl properties for this file. Using acl provide read + write '(rw)' permissions to group banner (i.e entity is banner and etype is group).

        entity: tony
        etype: group
        permissions: r
        state: present
      when: inventory_hostname == 'app_server_1'

    - name: Create story.txt and set ACL for user steve on app server 2

      when: inventory_hostname == 'app_server_3'
    
    - name: Set ACL for group banner on media.txt
      acl:
